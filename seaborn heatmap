Heatmaps in Seaborn can be plotted by using the seaborn.heatmap() function.
There are some of the important parameters.
data: 2D dataset that can be coerced into an ndarray.
vmin, vmax: Values to anchor the colormap, otherwise they are inferred from the data and other keyword arguments.
cmap: The mapping from data values to color space.
center: The value at which to center the colormap when plotting divergent data.
annot: If True, write the data value in each cell.
fmt: String formatting code to use when adding annotations.
linewidths: Width of the lines that will divide each cell.
linecolor: Color of the lines that will divide each cell.
